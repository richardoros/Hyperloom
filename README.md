ROCm™ Hyperloom is an autonomous agentic system designed to optimize end-to-end inference workloads
(targeting both host code and GPU kernels) on AMD GPUs. Using advanced AI agents and profiling tools,
Hyperloom analyzes your workload, identifies performance bottlenecks, implements targeted optimizations,
and validates the performance and correctness of the optimizations without requiring manual intervention.
 
The system operates through a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline. First TraceLens, the profiling brain of
the workload understanding stage, consumes traces collected by Magpie (which in turn relies on IntelliKit
for some low-level GPU profiling tools), captures bottlenecks, and derives the roofline targets that seed
the optimization search tree.

Next, Hyperloom employs a self-evolving code optimization engine following an iterative agentic loop (Think
→ Decide → Implement → Benchmark). Arbor intelligently explores the optimization space using a Dynamic
Specialist Agent and Knowledge Base. In parallel to Arbor, GEAK, a multi-agent GPU performance optimizer,
optimizes hot kernels. Once optimizations are identified and validated, Hyperloom prepares
the optimized code and generates a report with all proposed changes and expected performance improvements.
This end-to-end automation enables developers to achieve significant performance improvements while
maintaining code quality and reducing the manual effort traditionally required for GPU optimization.

Hyperloom combines:

- Trace analysis, identifying bottleneck kernels and bridge planning through
  [TraceLens](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens) Agent (backend support
   from [Magpie](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Magpie) and
   [Intellikit](https://github.com/AMDResearch/intellikit))
- Kernel optimization through the
  [GEAK](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/GEAK) backend.
- Agentic search space exploration through
  [Arbor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.12563), a tree-based cognition layer
  with dynamic agents, long-horizon campaigns, and self-evolving optimization
  guided by a curated knowledge base of hardware learnings, pitfalls, and
  prior campaign artifacts.

## Developer Entry Points

- Runtime package: `src/hyperloom/`
- Main agent instructions: [`src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md`](src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md)
- CLI entry point: `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize`
- Operator tools: `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.*`
- Platform tuning audit: `python3 scripts/platform_audit.py` — checks the host CPU
  tuning that silently changes benchmark results. Judges Core Performance Boost and
  the cpufreq governor against [AMD's BIOS & Workload Tuning Guide for EPYC 9004][58011];
  records determinism, SMT and NPS without a verdict, because chapter 5 varies those
  by workload or the OS layer can only infer them. Reads `/sys`, `/proc` and — as
  root — the HWCR MSR; no credentials, nothing written. Exit `0` on target, `1` a
  knob is wrong, `2` unresolved, which CI should treat as missing coverage rather
  than as a failure. The BIOS-only knobs are not reachable this way; see below.
- BIOS audit over the BMC: `sudo python3 scripts/platform_audit_bmc.py --bmc-user <ro>`
  — covers the three knobs the OS cannot see (High Performance profile, APBDIS, DF
  C-states), targeted per [58011][58011] §4.2.1, §4.4.3 and §4.4.4. Without
  `--bmc-user` it refuses to run unless `--allow-account-creation` is passed, because
  that path **mints a temporary ADMINISTRATOR account on the BMC**; exit `3` means
  such an account was left enabled or could not be confirmed revoked, and should page
  someone. The script's docstring has the account lifecycle and the rest of the exit
  codes.
