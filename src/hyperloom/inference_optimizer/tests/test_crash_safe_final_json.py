"""End-to-end proof that a non-graceful exit still yields final.json.

Launches a real subprocess that mirrors how ``cli.py`` runs the optimizer: it
installs an asyncio SIGINT/SIGTERM handler that lets the event loop unwind, and
calls ``write_minimal_final_json`` from a ``finally`` block. A real signal is
sent and the on-disk result asserted, pinning down which kill modes the fix
covers.
