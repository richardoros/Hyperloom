description: |
  Build a single self-contained `session_breakdown.json` capturing every
  fact a dashboard needs about one hyperloom optimization session. Use
  when the user mentions session-breakdown, kernel attribution,
  a stats/reporting service, capability summary, or wants to surface hyperloom
  data to an external consumer (a results/stats service, notebook, dashboard).
globs:
  - "**/breakdown/**"
  - "**/session_breakdown*"
  - "**/dump_session_breakdown*"

# Session Breakdown Skill

## What it produces

A single JSON file: **`<session_dir>/session_breakdown.json`**.

- Schema:   `hyperloom.session_breakdown.v3.0` when recorder fragments are present, else `…v2` (collector-only fallback). Same additive wire shape; gate consumers on the major version, not exact-string equality. See `breakdown/schema.py` (`SCHEMA_VERSION` / `SCHEMA_VERSION_V3`).
- Producer: `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/breakdown/exporter.py`
- Filename: `BREAKDOWN_FILENAME` (= `session_breakdown.json`)

Beyond the envelope (`schema_version` / `exported_at_utc` / `exporter_version`), the JSON
carries the sections below. This is the subset most consumers use, not the full set —
`breakdown/exporter.py` (the `breakdown = {...}` literal) and `breakdown/schema.py` are
authoritative.

| Section              | What it carries                                                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session`            | Internal `session_id`, Claw `claw_session_id`, sandbox user, start/end ts, stop_reason, host, code SHA.  |
| `workload`           | Framework, model, GPU, TP, CONC/ISL/OSL/precision, objective.                                            |
| `baseline`           | Baseline throughput / accuracy / latency, config path, benchmark report path, failure streak.            |
| `final`              | `current_best` throughput, validated cumulative gain, action path, extra args/envs.                      |
| `phase_timeline`     | Chronological list of every action attempt + kernel_opt + integrate event.                               |
| `capability_summary` | One row per live capability: geak / forge / explore / sweep / specialist, plus legacy rows kept for archived sessions. |
| `geak_invocations`   | Per-attempt detail: prompt path, optimized files, verification, decision, micro_speedup.                 |
| `forge_invocations`  | Per-attempt detail for the forge backend.                                                               |
| `kernel_lifecycle`   | 5 stages: `detected` / `recommended` / `optimized` / `adopted` / `rejected`.                             |
| `collective`         | Collective-lane campaigns: `only_mode` / `attempts[]` / `last`. Adoption is decided by `integration_decision` (E2E gate), not `decision` (microbenchmark). |
| `param_search`       | Compatibility alias for the merged explore ledger (tested / accepted / rejected / top_by_gain / winner_history). |
| `sweep`              | Grid size, best_overall, pareto_front, every variant's benchmark numbers.                                |
| `critic_robustness`  | Per-iter critic verdicts + robustness signals.                                                           |
| `telemetry`          | Paths to `benchmark_report.json` / `torch_trace` / `system_profile` / server logs + aggregated GPU monitor. `telemetry.orchestration_context` carries the compaction-loop health: `seed_prompts`, `delta_prompts`, `compactions`, `degenerate_compactions`, `tick_count`, `compactions_per_tick`, `delta_ratio`, `context_tokens_at_compaction`. See `docs/reference/session-breakdown.md §telemetry.orchestration_context`. |
| `attribution`        | Per-stack-entry gain ledger + family breakdown (geak / forge / explore / sweep / legacy aliases).        |
| `warnings`           | Best-effort caveats (missing files, partial sections, reconstructed fields).                             |
| `source_files`       | Mapping from logical section to relative path under `session_dir`.                                       |

## Who reads it

- **A downstream stats/reporting service** — primary consumer. Replaces the
  MAE-synthesized `raw_report` / `fact_sheet`. Recommended read order:
  prefer `session_breakdown.json` if present, fall back to legacy MAE
  output otherwise.
- **`hyperloom-results-service`** — downstream automation may POST this
  JSON when `HYPERLOOM_RESULTS_SERVICE_URL` is set.
- **Offline / notebook analysis** — single file, easy to load, no DB
  needed.

## When to refresh (LLM Orchestrator decision tree)

The Coordinator's `cli.py` finally block writes `session_breakdown.json`
unconditionally at end-of-session — that's the safety net. But you
should ALSO refresh it eagerly when downstream dashboards may be
watching this session live:

1. **Always** at end-of-session (handled by `cli.py finally` — you do not need to dispatch this).
2. After every KEEP'd explore, specialist, framework, or kernel result
   whose benchmark changed the final stack.
3. After a successful sweep or conc_sweep when a live dashboard is
   observing this session.
4. **Never** mid-action — collectors expect a coherent state snapshot.

Dispatch action `session_breakdown` — a single 1-minute action, no inputs
required.

## How to invoke

### LLM-driven (Coordinator action)

```yaml
# Issue an action intent like any other action
{ "action": "session_breakdown", "params": {} }
```

### Code-driven (Python import)

```python
from hyperloom.inference_optimizer.breakdown import build, write_breakdown_json

# Just compute the dict (no side effects)
breakdown = build("/workspace/hyperloom")

# Compute + atomically write to <sd>/session_breakdown.json
out_path = write_breakdown_json("/workspace/hyperloom")
```

### CLI / offline (`hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown`)

```bash
# Live session in this sandbox
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown

# Historical session on a shared filesystem
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
    --session-dir /shared/hyperloom-sessions/<user>/<sid>

# Override output path (e.g. write to a staging area)
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
    --session-dir <SD> --output /tmp/breakdown.json
```

### Bulk historical (operator)

```bash
for d in /shared/hyperloom-sessions/*/*; do
    [ -d "$d" ] || continue
    python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
        --session-dir "$d" > /dev/null
done
```

## Field reference (what comes from where)

The collector for each section reads only from the listed sources. All
collectors are pure functions; failure in one section never poisons
another (each becomes a `warnings[]` entry instead). Like the table above,
this reference is partial — `breakdown/exporter.py` is authoritative.

| Section              | Reads from                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session`            | `manifest.json` + `state.{session_id, stop_reason, max_minutes, tick, start_ts}`                                     |
| `workload`           | `manifest.{framework, model_*, gpu_type, tp, workload, objective}` + `state.{model_class, framework, gpu_type}`      |
| `baseline`           | `state.{baseline_tput, baseline_accuracy, last_baseline.workspace, baseline_attempts}` + `<workspace>/benchmark_*/benchmark_report.json` |
| `final`              | `state.{current_best, cumulative_gain, cumulative_gain_validated_*, optimization_stack}`                            |
| `phase_timeline`     | `state.{<action>_attempts, kernel_opt_attempts.history, kernel_integrate_attempts.attempts}` sorted by `ts`           |
| `capability_summary` | Reduces invocations + per-action attempts + search ledgers into 8 rows: geak / forge / explore / sweep / specialist plus the backends / params / validate_stack compatibility rows |
| `geak_invocations`   | `kernel-agent/runs/<sid>/{optimization_attempts.jsonl, prompts/, optimized/, results/, verification/}` filtered by `backend == "geak"` (also scans legacy `kernel-agent-workspace/.../kernel-agent/runs/...` for historical sessions). Per-attempt files under `optimized/` are discovered by `glob("<attempt_id>*")`, so both the historical `<attempt_id>_optimized.<suffix>` name and the post-2026-05 `<attempt_id>_stdout.log` name are picked up transparently — see `docs/conceptual/kernel-execution-path.md` § *Per-attempt stdout file naming*. |
| `forge_invocations`  | Same as GEAK, filtered by `backend == "forge"`                                                                        |
| `kernel_lifecycle`   | `runs/profile/*/benchmark_*/benchmark_report.json` (detected) + `state.last_trace_analyze` (recommended) + invocations folded (optimized) + `state.{kernel_integrate_attempts, rejected_kernel_*}` (adopted/rejected) |
| `collective`         | `state.{collective_only_mode, collective_attempts, last_collective}`                                                  |
| `param_search`       | `state.{explore_search, discovered_flags}` (`synergy_attempted` now comes from `explore_search`; `winner_history` / `backend_winners_history` are emitted empty); `params` / `backends` ledgers are historical aliases only |
| `sweep`              | `state.last_sweep` + `runs/sweep/<task>/variant_*/benchmark_*/benchmark_report.json`                                |
| `critic_robustness`  | `critic-workdir/<NNN>/{request,judge_bundle,emit,review}.json` + `robustness-workdir/<NNN>/{signal,action}.json`   |
| `telemetry`          | All `runs/**/benchmark_*/benchmark_report.json` + `torch_trace/` + `system_profile/` + `server*.log`                  |
| `attribution`        | `state.gain_per_stack_entry` (preferred) OR best-effort reconstruction from `state.optimization_stack`              |

## What is NOT in scope

- **Real-time event streaming** — use `claw_session_events` for that.
- **LLM-based attribution** — every collector is deterministic /
  rule-based. Attribution is `delta_pct` math, not natural language.
- **Schema migration** — consumers MUST check `schema_version` and gate
  features on it, comparing the **major** version (`vN`) rather than the
  exact string: the producer emits both `…v2` and `…v3.0` today (see
  Versioning policy) and they are wire-compatible.
- **Cross-session aggregation** — one file per session. Use a Jupyter
  notebook or downstream analytics job for fleet views.

## Failure modes

| Symptom                                            | Cause                                                                                            | Mitigation                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `warnings: ["state.json missing"]`                 | Session was created (manifest written) but `Coordinator.save()` never ran                        | Sections fall back to manifest-only data.                                                  |
| `warnings: ["manifest.json missing"]`              | Session was created without the standard cli.py path (rare)                                      | `session.session_id` falls back to `state.session_id`.                                     |
| `attribution.notes ≠ []`                            | `Coordinator` did not write `state.gain_per_stack_entry`                                         | Attribution is reconstructed from `optimization_stack`; consumer should treat as approximate. |
| Empty `geak_invocations` & `forge_invocations`      | Kernel-agent never ran, or wrote to a non-standard workspace                                     | Verify `$SD/kernel-agent/runs/` exists (or, for pre-migration sessions, `$SD/kernel-agent-workspace/kernel-agent/runs/`). |
| `kernel_lifecycle.detected = []`                    | `profile` action never ran or its `benchmark_report.json` had no `kernel_summary`                | Re-run profile, or fall back to `recommended` from `state.last_trace_analyze`.            |
| Large `warnings[]`                                   | Multiple JSON parse failures on `optimization_attempts.jsonl`                                    | Inspect `kernel-agent-workspace/.../logs/` for the corresponding kernel-agent CLI logs.    |

## Versioning policy

- `schema_version` (in `schema.py`) carries the **major** contract
  version; it is bumped ONLY on breaking changes (renamed/removed
  fields, changed semantics).
- Two strings are in production today: `…v3.0` when the exporter
  aggregates author-time recorder fragments, `…v2` for the legacy
  collector-only fallback. They share one additive wire shape, so
  consumers MUST match on the `vN` major prefix (or allowlist both),
  never on exact-string equality.
- Adding optional fields is **never** a breaking change.
- `exporter_version` tracks the exporter implementation independently;
  consumers can ignore it.

## Testing

Each collector has a unit test under `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tests/`
that runs it against a fixture session_dir tree. An end-to-end test calls
`build(...)` on a fully-populated fixture and JSON-schema-validates the
result. Run:

```bash
pytest src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tests/ -k breakdown -v
```
