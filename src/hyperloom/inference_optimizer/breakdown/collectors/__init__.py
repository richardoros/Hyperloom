"""Deterministic collectors for ``session_breakdown.json``.

Each ``collect_<section>`` is a pure function over ``session_dir`` / ``state`` /
``manifest`` returning its schema section (see :mod:`..schema`). Collectors never
mutate state, fabricate values, or raise — failures are recorded in ``warnings``
and the section returns a best-effort partial.

Split into cohesive submodules (shared foundation helpers in :mod:`._common`);
this package re-exports the full namespace so every importer and monkeypatch
site keeps working.
