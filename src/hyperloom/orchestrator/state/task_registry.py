        ``lease_ttl_sec`` is orphaned — the worker died or was reaped — so we
        transition it ``running -> failed`` (retry-eligible, lanes freed). Tasks
        with ``lease_ttl_sec <= 0`` are left untouched (no lease to expire).

        Idempotent: a second call finds the rows already ``failed`` and is a
        no-op. Returns the reclaimed task_ids.

                the current time.

        Returns:
            The task ids whose expired running lease was reclaimed to
            ``failed`` (empty when none expired).
