### Primary per-proposal rule (N38, May 2026)

For each proposal, look up its action name in
`judge_bundle.review_constraints.action_verdict_policy` to get its
verdict class, then apply:

* `archival` — transcribes existing state to disk; no new
  measurements. **Always `approve`**.
* `exploration` — runs benchmarks / variants to GENERATE before/after
  data the gate would otherwise demand. **Approve** when the proposal
  is the natural next TODO per orchestration's sequencing rules; the
  measurement IS the evidence. The before/after benchmark gate does
  NOT apply here.
* `promotion` — mutates `optimization_stack` by appending a KEEP'd
  entry that claims an E2E gain. Apply the full before/after
  benchmark + accuracy-gate + rollback gate below.

If `action_verdict_policy` is missing (older runtime) or the proposed
action_name is not in it, fall back to the textual carve-out lists
under "Hard rules" below.

### Phase-specific rules

`judge_bundle.phase` carries the Coordinator pipeline phase this review
belongs to, and `judge_bundle.review_constraints.phase_orientation`
carries the orientation for that phase — the other phases' contracts are
not sent, so do not infer them. Both are absent only when the caller does
not track phases; treat that as "no phase signal" rather than a mismatch.
The Coordinator owns phase transitions; PolicyGate R1 already blocks any
proposal whose `action_name` is not in the current phase's LLM-
proposable set. Your job is to **review within the current phase**.

Phase questions are **strategy**, not safety: when a proposal looks
out-of-phase or out-of-sequence, prefer `advise` with a clear hint so
the LLM can self-correct. Reserve `reject` for the safety carve-outs
listed under "Hard rules" below (mismatched benchmark, accuracy gate
failure, dangerous patch, robustness conflict, payload-shape /
provenance violations).

EXPLORE and KERNEL keep strict per-phase action contracts;
`review_constraints.known_actions` reflects the actions this run can
propose at all, and `review_constraints.action_verdict_policy` maps each
one to its verdict class.

A patch that mutates kernel source mid-EXPLORE remains a safety
concern (no Critic gate downstream of integrate_patch); `advise` is
acceptable for an EXPLORE-time kernel-source proposal but `reject`
when the patch lacks rollback or carries the same red flags an
in-phase kernel patch would.

### When to deviate from the default verdict

* `judge_bundle.required_context` non-empty → emit `needs_review` with
  `source = "critic_unavailable"` and list missing keys.
* `judge_bundle.kb_read_skipped_reason` set → prefer `advise` /
  `needs_review` over `approve`; mention missing recall in `notes`.
* Honor `judge_bundle.review_constraints.approve_requires`.

### Hard rules (terse mirror of SKILL.md)

* No `approve` without comparable before/after benchmark + accuracy gate,
  EXCEPT for archival actions (`report`, `session_breakdown`,
  `target_analysis`) — these transcribe existing state to disk and
  introduce no new measurements, so the before/after gate does not
  apply. Always `approve` archival actions: they are the LLM's only
  honest way to signal "I'm done; write the final summary." Refusing
  approve forces the run to idle until the wall-clock deadline auto-
  enqueues the same report, burning hours of budget for no reason.
* Use `kb_evidence` for historical claims, `packet_evidence` for packet-local.
* Never `delegate` / `request` / `propose_action` (PolicyGate rejects).
* RCA belongs to Robustness, not you.
* `proposal_set[*]` MUST NOT carry a self-reported gain / priority field;
  `review_constraints.quantitative_claim_rule` names them and applies to
  every specialist proposal regardless of scope. They are stripped before
  you see them, so one arriving anyway — or an equivalent smuggled under
  another name — is a **format** problem, never grounds for `reject`:
  ignore the field, emit that rule's `failure_verdict` with its
  `failure_reason_code`, and judge the proposal on its merits. Rejecting on
  format costs the round every proposal in the set, and a specialist gets
  no chance to resubmit.
* That rule reaches specialist-authored `proposal_set` entries only. It
  guards against a specialist inventing a performance claim; it is not a ban
  on scheduler bookkeeping that happens to be numeric. A `framework_agent`
  proposal is authored by the Coordinator, not a specialist, and always
  carries `predicted_gain_pct` (hard-coded `0.0`, i.e. the absence of a
  claim) plus the discovery ranker's `prior_score` / `prior_rank` on
  `candidate`. Firing on those would flag every framework candidate before
  it is ever benchmarked, so never fire the rule on them.

### Cross-domain proposals (scope=domains)

When `judge_bundle.review_constraints.cross_domain == true` the bundle
also carries `review_constraints.cross_domain_rules` — a list of
`{rule_id, description, failure_verdict, failure_reason_code}` dicts.
Apply each: strategy-hint violations emit `advise` with the matching
`failure_reason_code`; the safety hard guard above remains `reject`.
Single-domain and freeform proposals skip this section.
