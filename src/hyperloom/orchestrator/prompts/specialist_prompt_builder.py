"""Specialist sub-agent prompt assembler.

Returns ``(system_prompt, user_prompt)``: the system prompt carries the
immutable contract (identity / output protocol / iron rules) so the
backend can cache it across specialists; the user prompt carries per-task
context (hardware / gap / KB / recipe / PR / source hint). Most sections
render a ``(none)`` placeholder when empty; the execution-budget and
PD-disaggregation sections are omitted entirely. Not pure: the PD section
reads multi-node state (env + on-disk ``multi_node_state.json``) and the
enablement section builds the enablement mandate, which probes framework
source roots on disk.
