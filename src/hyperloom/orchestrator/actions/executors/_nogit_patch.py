"""Shared non-git patch apply / revert primitives.

Lets the EXPLORE specialist executor and the FRAMEWORK-phase per-candidate
executor share one backup-based apply/revert channel without git.

Public surface
--------------
* :func:`_is_git_tree`           — probe whether a directory is inside a git work-tree.
* :func:`_apply_patch_no_git`    — apply a unified diff with POSIX ``patch``, backing up targets.
* :func:`_revert_patches_no_git` — restore backed-up targets (reverse of apply).

Supporting constants / helpers used by both callers:

* :data:`_P_LEVELS`         — ``-p`` strip levels tried in priority order.
* :data:`_PATCH_DEV_NULL`   — the sentinel ``/dev/null`` path in diff headers.
* :func:`_strip_path_prefix` — drop leading path components like ``git apply -p<n>``.
* :func:`_is_within`        — containment check (both paths pre-resolved).

Backup naming
-------------
Backup files are named ``<patch_stem>__<rel_flat>__<seq:04d>.bak`` where
``rel_flat`` is the target's relative path with ``/`` replaced by ``__`` and
``seq`` is a caller-supplied offset (``seq_offset``) plus the record index.
Callers that accumulate backups across multiple ``_apply_patch_no_git`` calls
pass ``seq_offset=len(existing_backups)`` so names are globally unique within a
shared ``backup_root`` even when patches touch files with the same basename.

Rename / move revert
--------------------
For a rename hunk (``---`` old path != ``+++`` new path, neither ``/dev/null``),
``_apply_patch_no_git`` backs up the old source file (to restore on revert) and
tracks the new destination (to delete on revert). Each backup record carries a
``revert_action`` key:

* ``"restore"`` — copy ``backup_path`` back to ``target`` (modified/created files).
* ``"delete"``  — remove ``target`` (the rename destination, which did not exist
  before the patch).
* ``"restore_old"`` — copy ``backup_path`` back to ``target`` (the rename source,
  which existed before the patch and must be put back).

``_revert_patches_no_git`` dispatches on ``revert_action`` (falling back to the
``backup_path``-present → restore / absent → delete heuristic for older records).
