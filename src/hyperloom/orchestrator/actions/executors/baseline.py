        A baseline is supposed to establish the accuracy reference. If the
        accuracy test was expected to run but produced no usable result, the
        setup is fundamentally broken and the whole run stops.

        "No usable result" means a missing or non-positive accuracy: scriptable
        workloads record ``accuracy=0.0`` (fail-closed) when the quality gate is
        absent, and serving records no accuracy at all, so both are covered.

        Incidental disabling is no opt-out. ``disable_run_eval``, an explicit
        ``RUN_EVAL=false`` env, or a YAML/reference-env value do not make a
        missing accuracy acceptable on a genuine baseline -- they only mean the
        reference was never measured, which is exactly what this guard rejects.
        Two deliberate opt-outs exist: ``quality_ref_exempt`` (synthetic
        kernel-lane re-baselines) and ``--no-eval`` (no reference was asked for).

        With eval-on-fail enablement active (the default), the result is stamped
        as an eval-failure contract -- ``eval_generation_pathology`` when the
        generation probe tripped, else whatever the score classifies as -- and
        routed to enablement rather than
        stopping; ``_is_promotable_result`` then blocks it from anchoring
        ``baseline_tput`` / ``baseline_accuracy`` / ``baseline_config_path``.

        An over-prediction of what the next one will cost, and knowingly so. The
        figure comes from a pass that paid the one-time JIT compile on a fresh
        kernel cache, which a later pass on the same signature does not pay
        again; the executor's own cache probe is built on that difference, and
        picks a cap 20 minutes shorter when it finds the cache warm.

        Over-predicting is the tolerable direction *for this caller only*, and
        the reason is in :meth:`_round_affordable_before_ignition`: a refusal
        here costs the session a fresh anchor it can do without, because the
        anchor it already has still stands. No caller that would end a session on
        this figure may use it.

        The two passes are priced apart because they buy different things -- the
        first boots the server and pays the compile and the graph capture, the
        second re-attaches a client to a server already up -- and each is added
        only once it has been measured.

        A session can hold the cold figure without the hot one, and that is not a
        corner case: a round whose measured pass was dropped for budget promotes
        its cold number as the anchor and has no hot number to write. Such a
        session is the one most in need of this gate, so its cold pass is still
        priced; only the pass it cannot price is left out, and whether that one
        may follow is settled after the warmup as usual.

        The companion to :meth:`_measure_round_affordable`, and the two divide
        the session's baselines between them. A session's first round is not
        asked this question, because there is nothing to ask it with: the
        measured runtimes are written only once an anchor lands, so a gate here
        would either refuse every first baseline or wave every one through. That
        round runs, and whether a second pass may follow is settled afterwards
        against what the first actually cost.

        Every later round has at least the previous one's cold figure, and by then
        an anchor already exists. That is what makes this gate safe to build on an
        over-predicting figure: the two outcomes are not symmetric. Igniting a
        round that cannot finish costs a boot, a compile and a graph capture for a
        number that must then be marked cold. Refusing one that would have fitted
        costs a fresh anchor the session did not need, because the anchor it
        measured earlier still stands and every later comparison is made against
        that one.

        The asymmetry is the whole justification, so it may not be borrowed. A

        The pass exists because the restart just above it left a cold server and

        it moves the round's measurement onto a cold server and anchors the

        Both passes run under the round's own cap, which the session clamp leaves
        past the session deadline so a budget kill arrives as the watchdog's

        and puts the round back in reach of its own timeout.
