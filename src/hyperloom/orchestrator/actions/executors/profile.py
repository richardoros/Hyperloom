"""Real ``profile`` ActionRunner — Magpie run with torch profiler on.

Reuses the BaselineExecutor shell-out machinery; only the YAML differs
(``profiler.torch_profiler.enabled: true``), so Magpie writes trace files
under ``torch_trace/`` (or ``capture_traces/`` for TraceLens vLLM capture).

Result schema (delivered on the bus as ``delegated_result``)::

    status:        "succeeded" | "failed"
    framework:     "sglang" | "vllm" | "atom" | "xdit" | "custom"
    model:         path
    request/output/total_token_throughput, latency stats (same as baseline)
    workspace:     absolute path of the Magpie workspace
    trace_dir:     absolute path of the torch_trace dir (or None)
    trace_files:   absolute paths of the selected trace files
    main_trace_path: absolute path of the chosen main trace
    trace_health:  structure-check dict (see _validate_trace_structure)
    profile_trace_selection_reason: why that main trace was picked
    report_path:   absolute path of benchmark_report.json
    error_class / error: set on the failure path (e.g. "no_trace_files")

In-repo consumers (roofline.py, loop/writeback.py) prefer ``main_trace_path``
and fall back to ``trace_files[0]``; the rest is surfaced so the baseline
SharedState promotion works unchanged.
