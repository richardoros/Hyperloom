        a benchmark failure (rc=1) rather than crashing the session.

        The cancel scope published by the dispatcher is watched for as long as
        the round is in flight, the same as on the local path -- the difference
        is that the round is in another process, so the scope cannot be read
        there and the cancel is forwarded to the actor instead.

        Args:
            cmd: The benchmark command to run inside the actor.
            env: Caller env for the subprocess.
            cwd: Working directory for the subprocess.
            timeout: Hard timeout in seconds.
            soft_deadline_sec: Overtime soft deadline.
            server_log_path: Path to the server log for the watchdogs.
            server_already_ready: Warm reuse round (soft clock from spawn).
            session_remaining_sec: Seconds left on the session budget, as
                produced by ``session_deadline_to_remaining_sec``. The absolute
                deadline the local path uses cannot cross into the actor: it is
                a ``time.monotonic()`` instant, and the actor's clock has its own
                origin. The actor re-anchors this duration onto its own clock.

            ``(returncode, stdout, stderr)`` from the round.
