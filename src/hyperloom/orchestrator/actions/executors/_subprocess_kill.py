"""Reliable subprocess-tree teardown for Magpie-launched servers.

Magpie's shell wrappers ``trap``/``setsid``/``nohup`` the vLLM/SGLang server,
so on a Hyperloom-side timeout or error the server child can survive, holding
GPU memory and keeping a ``bash`` alive that may later re-source a script
mid-copy. To prevent that, Magpie is launched in its own POSIX session
(``start_new_session=True``) so ``os.killpg`` reaps the whole tree, and
:func:`kill_my_spawned_server` is called from every exit path (idempotent,
never raises). Scoped strictly to the tree we created, so it's safe on every
benchmark call.

    to this moment on one ``time.monotonic()`` reading in the process that
    spawned the child. The wall-clock instant beside it only ever says *which
    round* the stamp belongs to.

    Keeping the boot a duration is what makes it safe to read across a process

    host; subtracting the actor's wall-clock from the driver's would charge the
    boot for whatever the two clocks disagree by, and a positive disagreement
    inflates the boot and makes the budget gates refuse rounds that fit. A
    duration crosses the boundary meaning the same thing on both sides -- the
    same reason ``session_remaining_sec`` is passed to the actor as a duration
    rather than as a deadline.

    A file is used because it crosses that boundary without widening the round's
    return value, and the round's output directory is already how post-mortem
    evidence gets back (the caller reads the same directory's ``server.log`` to
