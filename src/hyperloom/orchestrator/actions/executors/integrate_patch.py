        The verdict depends on the trigger origin, because the two origins have
        different evidence available:

        * ``accuracy >= floor`` -> ``correctness_ok=True`` (KEEP, verified).
          eval-origin additionally requires the score to carry a task + metric;
          without them it did not come from a real eval and fails closed.
        * present but below floor / non-positive / non-finite ->
          ``correctness_ok=False`` (REVERT, garbage output).
        * ``accuracy is None`` -> eval-origin fails closed
          (``correctness_ok=False``): the trigger *was* an accuracy failure, so a
          candidate that produces no score has not shown it fixed anything.
          boot-origin stays ``None`` (KEEP but provisional) — it only ever
          claimed to make the model boot, and eval-less runs must not be blocked.

        On KEEP the benched env/arg layers are reported as
        ``enablement_effective_config``, captured from the variant that ran: the
        materialized YAML holds only the base layer, so the revalidation baseline
        needs them to re-run the graded config.
        When an attempt runtime was provisioned, the stack action is recorded in
        the result (``enablement_kept_stack_action``) so it survives rearm. On
        REVERT / non-KEEP, the attempt runtime dir is GC'd.

        The whole lever mechanism rests on one invariant: with no switch set, the

        per-lever measurement mean anything, and what keeps the baseline
        comparable across a session that has accumulated several rewrite patches.
        It is also the invariant an LLM is most likely to break by accident — by
        reading the switch once at import, inverting a default, or restructuring
        code outside the guard — and nothing else in the pipeline would notice: a
        switches-on bench that improves throughput looks like a success whether or
        not the switches-off path still works.

        So it is measured, not assumed. One extra leg with the switches removed
        must land inside a noise band around the pre-patch base.
