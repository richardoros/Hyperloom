# margin over ``base_tput`` -- i.e. still reproduce a positive gain above grid
# noise -- rather than merely not regressing (a 0.0 floor only checks
# non-regression and lets noise-level "wins" survive). Kept below the KEEP gate
# (the grid noise floor) so confirmation is a stability check, not a second
# discovery gate. Override per task via ``params['stack_stable_threshold_pct']``

    ``soft_deadline_sec`` applies the overtime soft-kill so a pathological
    post-sample server drain is bounded rather than running until the hard
    ``variant_timeout_sec``. ``server_already_ready`` should be ``True`` when
    ``server_lifecycle`` enables cleanup-reuse (the subprocess re-attaches to a
    hot server and never writes a ready marker, which would otherwise leave the
    from-ready soft clock un-armed). ``serving_lease`` (Ray-managed GPU
    execution, §12 T1) routes the round through the caller's held Ray lease so
    the rebench shares the same lease as the warmup/decision rounds it reuses
    the hot server from; ``None`` keeps the local path.

    ``session_deadline_sec`` bounds the rebench by the session wall-clock, so a
    confirmation round cannot outlive the run it is confirming for.
    A rebench dropped for lack of budget is reported as its own warning rather
    than as a failed measurement: not measuring a variant is not evidence that
    the variant is unstable, and the caller grades on the distinction.
