"""Real ``report`` ActionRunner.

Reads SharedState + the bus event log and writes
``$SESSION_DIR/reports/final.json`` (machine-readable, dashboard shape) and
``final.md`` (human-readable). The returned dict surfaces both paths.
``final.json`` carries the run identity, stop reason, baseline/best, per-round
and validated cumulative gain, completeness annotations, event counts and
highlights, plus optional blocks (failure summary, roofline comparison,
external baseline, concurrency-sweep and kernel-optimization pointers) when the
corresponding data exists; ``final.md`` renders the same content as sections.
Side artifacts land in the same reports directory:
``kernel_optimization_summary.json`` and ``conc_sweep_curve.png``. See
