"""Idempotent, backward-compatible patchers for the InferenceX checkout.

Each ``ensure_*`` function rewrites one upstream file in place: ``$NUM_PROMPTS``
support and ``PROFILE_EXTRA_BODY`` consumption for profiling, the eval-artifact
redirect to ``$RESULT_DIR``, the ``HYPERLOOM_EVAL_START`` phase marker, and the
generation-pathology probe plus per-request generation bounds and model-derived
terminators appended to lm-eval's ``lm_eval_sitecustomize.py``.

Applied in place, once: idempotent via a sentinel substring, serialized across
processes via ``fcntl.flock``, written atomically.

The four line-replacement patches are gated on locating exact upstream text, so a
``False`` return is ambiguous on its own -- it reads the same whether there was
nothing to patch or the anchor rotted. :func:`verify_patch_anchors` reports that
distinction without touching the checkout, so callers can assert the contract
instead of inferring it. The probe needs none of this: it is appended to a real
file, and :func:`eval_probe_targets_exist` already separates the two cases.

# Anchor contract
# =====================================================================
# The probe no longer has an anchor to rot: it is appended to a real file, and
# ``eval_probe_targets_exist`` already separates "present and unpatchable" from
# "laid out somewhere we do not look". The four patches below are still gated on
# locating exact upstream text, which makes a cosmetic upstream edit
# indistinguishable from "nothing to patch": the ``ensure_*`` call returns False,
# no caller reads it, and the run proceeds with the patch silently absent -- the
# same failure mode that took the probe offline before it was re-homed.
# Verification is therefore separate from patching, so a caller can assert the
# contract instead of inferring it from a boolean nobody reads.
