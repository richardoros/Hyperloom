# How long a cancel waits for work that is listening on its cancel scope to stop
# itself, composed from the two things an action still has to do after it is
# asked:
#
# * stop the round in flight -- locally that is
#   :data:`COOPERATIVE_REAP_BUDGET_SEC`, through a Ray actor it is
#   :data:`CANCEL_ROUND_GRACE_SEC`, and whichever path this action took, only the
#   longer of the two bounds it;
# * release what the round held -- the driver-side teardown of the server it left
#   behind (:data:`TERM_GRACE_SECONDS`) and then the release of the Ray lease it
#   ran in (:data:`CLOSE_STOP_TIMEOUT_SEC`). A sequence, not alternatives: the
#   server is reaped BEFORE the lease is dropped so that no GPU process outlives
#   it (§4.2), and on the Ray path a single unwind pays both -- in the explore
#   executor the per-variant ``finally`` tears the server down and the enclosing
#   one then closes the round's lease; the baseline executor does the same two
#   calls in one ``finally``.
#
# Derived rather than picked, because these three windows only mean anything
# together. Each was plausible on its own at ten, eight and five seconds, and
# composed they said the dispatcher gives up a good five seconds before the work
# it is waiting for can finish -- so the honest sentinel the round was about to
# return was discarded for a hard ``CancelledError`` every time, which is exactly
# what the cooperative channel exists to avoid. Taking the longer of the two
# release terms instead of both reproduced that shortfall exactly, on the path
# that pays the most: the teardown a Ray round owes is not an alternative to
# closing its lease, it is what it does first.
#
# The enumeration above has to stay exhaustive, so a serial step the unwind takes
# and this sum does not name has to be removed from the unwind instead. One is:
# ``run_grid`` fires a robustness tick at each variant boundary, and a cooperative
# stop reaches that boundary the ordinary way, so the tick would sit between
# recording the round's row and releasing what the round held -- eight more
# seconds, spent observing the reap this cancel just ordered. It is skipped
# whenever the scope is already cancelled rather than budgeted for, because the
# rows the grid has already built are what a window short by those eight seconds
# throws away, and they are worth more than one tick.
#
# Past this window the coroutine is cancelled anyway, and the window is only ever
# spent when work is still unwinding: the wait ends the moment the last victim is
# done, so covering the teardown term costs a round that stops promptly nothing.
# What the budget case pays for it is five more seconds before the run crosses its
# deadline, because this wait runs inside the reserve the admission gate holds
# back. It does not come out of the closing phase, whose grace window is measured
# from the moment it starts, and five seconds of overshoot is cheaper than the
# attributed sentinel a hard cancel destroys.
