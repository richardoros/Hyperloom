"""Intent routing collaborator for :class:`Coordinator`.

:meth:`IntentRouter.handle_intent` validates an emitted intent through
``PolicyGate`` and dispatches it to the matching ``_handle_*`` method.

``IntentRouter`` holds a back-reference to its owning ``Coordinator`` and
delegates every attribute it does not define itself to that coordinator via
``__getattr__``, so handler bodies keep using ``self.shared_state`` /
``self.bus`` etc. ``Coordinator`` keeps thin forwarding shims that delegate
to the router.
