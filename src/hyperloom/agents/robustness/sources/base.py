"""Source protocol + DegradeRouter.

DegradeRouter routes to a primary source and falls back to a secondary
on repeated failure. State transitions emit one WARN log; in-state
retries are silent. State machine::

    HEALTHY  --(fail_streak >= fail_threshold)-->  DEGRADED
    DEGRADED --(success after recheck_interval_s)--> HEALTHY
    fallback --(SourceUnavailable)--> FAILED

DEGRADED means "use the fallback this tick"; the next tick re-probes
after ``recheck_interval_s``. FAILED applies to the fallback source when
it too is unavailable — the both-sources-unavailable snapshot.
