    The probe detects "process is alive but the server is wedged", so a refusal
    with no server process behind the port is the expected reading, not a
    fault: a session spends long stretches — preparation, analysis, the gap
    between two variants — with no server up by design, and alerting there
    tells an operator to restart something that was never meant to be running.

    That reasoning needs to know there is no server, which is not the same as
    failing to find one. When the process probe could not answer at all, the
    symptom is emitted with the uncertainty recorded in its evidence, so a
    broken ``ps`` cannot mute an unrelated finding.

    "No server process" also does not always mean no server was wanted. A
    server that died mid-benchmark leaves that exact snapshot while its own
    load generator keeps sending requests into a closed port, so a benchmark
    client of *this session* is treated as proof that something was supposed to
    be answering and the alert stands. A co-tenant's client on a shared node
