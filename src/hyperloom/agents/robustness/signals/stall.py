"""Agent-stall detection.

Computes each agent's last-activity timestamp from
:attr:`SourceData.coordinator_events` (plus inbox tail) and alerts when
idle past the threshold. Any event counts as activity, including
heartbeats.

Silence is only evidence of a stall when nothing else is moving. A phase whose
work is one multi-hour deterministic task — a baseline pair, a profile and its
roofline, an explore grid — has no LLM turn to emit, so agent silence there is
the design rather than a fault, and alerting on it trains operators to ignore
the signal. :attr:`SourceData.local_task_progress` carries the counter-evidence:
while an agent's *own* dispatched work is still reporting units, the accusation
is withheld and the tick reports ``agent_quiet_work_progressing`` instead. The
suppression has no wall-clock ceiling, because the work units it covers
routinely run past any threshold worth setting — a single warmup runs 3941s —
and a ceiling would make the alert fire on exactly the healthy runs it was
written to stay quiet about. What bounds it instead is the freshness of the
evidence: the moment the work stops reporting, the next tick accuses, at full
severity.

Severity therefore follows the evidence and not the length of the wait. A phase
that keeps reporting throughout stays an observation however long it runs;
elapsed silence only decides how loud the *accusation* is, once there is no
fresh evidence left to withhold it. The two cases carry different symptom names
so RCA can tell a healthy long phase from an agent that went quiet past
:attr:`StallConfig.severity_high_after_s`.

One reporting unit is enough to withhold even when the agent owns several, since
a quiet unit is not an agent fault and has the lease watchdog behind it. It is
still named in the evidence, so the healthy sibling stops being the only thing
an operator can see.
