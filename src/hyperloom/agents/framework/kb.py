"""Knowledge-base selector + contributor for framework-agent.

The KB splits in two. :func:`packaged_kb_root` is read-only seed data shipped
in the wheel; :func:`mutable_kb_root` is the per-deployment partition this
session reads and writes, and is the single owner of that path for both this
module and the orchestrator's ``kb_writeback``. Both resolve at call time so
tests can monkeypatch the environment. :func:`synthesize_findings` distils
:class:`Finding` records into a markdown blob for ``contribute_to_kb``; the
default path is pure-Python (zero deps), ``with_llm=True`` lazy-imports
``claude_agent_sdk``. Per-domain priority order is ``empirical_kb.md`` ->
