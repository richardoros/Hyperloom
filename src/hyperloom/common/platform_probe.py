"""Host CPU platform probe, shared by every caller that records tuning state.

Single source of truth for reading the handful of ``/sys`` and ``/proc`` values
that describe how a host is tuned: SMT, socket and NUMA counts, nodes-per-socket,
the cpufreq governor, and Core Performance Boost. It is shared rather than
reimplemented per caller because these reads have edge cases -- an empty-string
socket id, a container with no NUMA tree -- that every copy has to get right, and
a copy that gets one wrong reports a plausible wrong number rather than failing.

``scripts/platform_audit.py`` is the deliberate exception: it must run on hosts
with no Hyperloom install, so it carries its own copy and says so.

Design:

* **per-field degradation**: every field is read independently and falls back to
  ``None``/``"unknown"`` on its own. One unreadable file must not take the rest of
  the record with it, because the record exists to explain a result after the fact.
* **absence is not failure**: :func:`sysfs_available` separates "this host is not
  Linux sysfs" from "the probe broke", which a reader of an archived report cannot
  otherwise distinguish.
* **injectable root**: every function takes ``root`` so tests can build a fake
  ``/sys`` tree instead of monkeypatching module internals.
* **light and never raises**: stdlib plus ``hyperloom.common.provenance``, which
  is itself stdlib-only. Importable from any layer without a cycle, and cheap
  enough for the crash-safe writer to use after a run has already died.

    Lives here rather than beside the report renderer because both callers that
    need it, the run report and the crash-safe ``final.json`` writer, sit above
    ``hyperloom.common``. Reaching the other way round would make the crash path
    import a private symbol out of the orchestrator, and with it the message bus
    and a SQLite connection layer -- roughly 350 modules -- to fill in six fields
    at the exact moment those subsystems may be the thing that just failed.

    Always returns a dict carrying ``status``. An archived report must be able
    to distinguish "this host had no CPU sysfs" from "the probe broke", which a
    bare ``null`` cannot express, and that distinction matters precisely when
    someone is trying to explain a delta long after the run.

    Scope: this samples the calling process's own node. In a multi-node session
    that is usually not the benchmark node, so the record would describe a
    machine the numbers did not come from -- worse than no record, because it
    reads as fact. ``host`` names the sampled machine and ``multi_node_session``
    marks when the record is known to be partial.

    Args:
        gpu_type: Session ``--gpu-type``. Resolves the gfx arch from the board
            table, so building this record never spawns a probe subprocess.
        multi_node: Whether this is a >=2-node session, when the caller knows.
            ``None`` records that nobody established it, which is the honest
            answer on the crash path rather than an unearned ``False``.

    Returns:
