"""Canonical AMD GPU type -> dispatch identity table.

Owned here rather than in ``inference_optimizer`` so provenance can consult it
without importing a higher layer. ``gpu_types.py`` re-exports it, so there is
one table rather than two that drift.

Note the mapping is many-to-one: MI300X, MI308X and MI325X are all ``gfx942``.
An arch therefore identifies the ISA, not the board -- which is why the session
``--gpu-type`` remains the authority for anything that must tell them apart.
