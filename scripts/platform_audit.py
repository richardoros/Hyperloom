"""Audit the AMD EPYC CPU tuning that affects inference benchmark results.

Reads only what the operating system exposes -- ``/sys``, ``/proc`` and, when
run as root, the HWCR MSR.

Judges Core Performance Boost and the cpufreq governor. Records determinism
control, SMT and nodes-per-socket without a verdict. A knob is only judged when
there is a defensible answer *and* a trustworthy way to read it here; see
``SOURCE`` below for the citation and the per-knob reasoning.

Power is still the determinism setting to want, because it maximizes what a
given platform can do. It is recorded rather than judged because the OS layer
cannot read it -- only infer it from per-core frequency spread -- and that
inference is not steady enough to gate on. The cost of Power, that platforms
then differ from each other, is paid by recording the setting: a system-to-
system delta stays explicable because the report says which mode each run
was in.

Why check at all, given a session's A/B is same-machine: host tuning applies to
baseline and candidates alike, so it cancels out of the *delta*. It does not
cancel out of what the session exports. On a de-tuned node the absolute
throughput is low, and the optimizer is searching around a CPU-side bottleneck
that will not exist on a correct machine -- so the configuration it selects can
be tuned against a phantom constraint and is then filed in the recipe KB for
other people to use.

Scope: OS layer only. Three further knobs -- APBDIS, DF C-states and the
platform's High Performance profile -- are not readable this way on kernels
without ``amd_hsmp`` and require Redfish against the BMC. Reaching them means
minting a temporary privileged account on the service processor, which is a
different risk class from anything here, so it lives in a separate tool and its
own review rather than being smuggled in behind a ``--bmc-host`` flag.

Deliberately self-contained: the point of this script is to audit a node that
may not have Hyperloom installed, so it copies a little sysfs plumbing rather
than importing ``hyperloom.common.platform_probe``. That duplication is a
choice for portability, not drift -- the in-repo callers all share one helper.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/platform_audit.py            # full, ~10s of measurement
    python3 scripts/platform_audit.py --quick    # no load generation
    sudo python3 scripts/platform_audit.py       # adds the MSR reading
    python3 scripts/platform_audit.py --json

Exit codes:

    0  every checked knob is on target
    1  a knob is definitively wrong
    2  a knob could not be resolved on this host
