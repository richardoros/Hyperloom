# Kernel optimization execution path

Kernel work in Hyperloom is **not handled by an LLM agent**. Every kernel
`REQUEST` emitted by Orchestration is intercepted inline by the Coordinator
and routed to a registered Python handler. No LLM turn is consumed.

## Request dispatch

Orchestration emits a `request{target_agent: "kernel_agent", kind: "<kind>"}` intent.
`IntentRouter._handle_request` (`orchestrator/loop/intent_router.py`) intercepts it
before any agent backend runs:

1. `_sequence_denial_for_request` checks the baseline prerequisite — if
   `baseline_tput == 0` and the kind is not `trace_analyze`, the request is
   policy-denied immediately (no bus record, no cursor advance).
2. Records the request on the message bus (`source: "orchestration"`).
3. Checks `shared_state.kernel_enabled`; auto-rejects with `agent_disabled` when
   `False` (i.e. `--no-kernel`).
4. Looks up the handler in `KERNEL_REQUEST_HANDLERS`; auto-rejects with
   `unknown_kernel_kind` (and a `valid_kinds` list) when none is found.
5. Runs the handler inline: `result = await handler(payload, session_dir=...)`.
6. Posts a `response{source: "programmatic_handler"}` directly to the bus.
7. Advances the kernel cursor past the request sequence number.

No PolicyGate path runs for the RESPONSE because it is written directly via
`bus.append_and_seq`, not emitted by an LLM.

## Registered request kinds

| Request kind | Handler | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| `trace_analyze` | `trace_analyze_handler` | TraceLens `tracelens_analysis.py` |
| `run_gemm_tuning` | `run_gemm_tuning_handler` | GEAK or forge-gemm-tune |
| `run_collective` | `run_collective_handler` | forge-collective (collective rewrite) |
| `run_optimization` | `run_optimization_handler` | GEAK or Forge per-kernel |
| `integrate` | `integrate_handler` | patch → re-baseline → KEEP/REVERT |
| `apply_patch` | `integrate_handler` (alias) | same as `integrate` |

Any kind outside this table, including the action-name `kernel_opt`, yields an
immediate `unknown_kernel_kind` rejection.

Registration is not permission. `run_fusion` and `run_collective` are
Coordinator-owned lanes: they need a handler entry so the Coordinator can
dispatch them itself at KERNEL entry, but PolicyGate rejects an
orchestration-issued REQUEST for either
(`COORDINATOR_OWNED_KERNEL_REQUEST_KINDS` in
`inference_optimizer/protocol/action_surfaces.py`, raised as
`rule="phase_incompatible"`) — a direct request would skip the lane's entry
gate, its SharedState accounting and its integrate step. The kinds
orchestration may request are therefore `trace_analyze`, `run_gemm_tuning`,
`run_optimization`, `integrate` and `apply_patch`; the LLM sees the two lanes
only as `run_fusion_done` / `run_collective_done` inbox responses. PolicyGate
validates the REQUEST payload from orchestration (path-sandbox, phase-action
gate) but never sees the RESPONSE.

`run_fusion_handler` is absent from the table on purpose: `KernelPhase` awaits
it directly, so no request ever carries that kind.

## KERNEL phase entry: Coordinator-direct calls

When the Coordinator enters the KERNEL phase (`phases/kernel.py::_on_enter_kernel`, dispatched by `phases/machine.py::_on_phase_entered`),
it calls the handlers directly in Python — not through the REQUEST bus:

```python
result = await run_gemm_tuning_handler({...}, session_dir=session_dir)
# then the two Coordinator-owned lanes, each behind its own gate; both first
# resume a pending integration from the previous entry before starting anew:
await self._maybe_run_forge_fusion_before_kernel_opt()
await self._maybe_run_collective_before_kernel_opt()
# then, if candidates remain:
result = await run_optimization_handler({...}, session_dir=session_dir)
```

Results are synthesized as `kernel_agent → orchestration` response messages with
`source="kernel_entry_auto"` so orchestration's inbox looks the same as if the
request had come through the bus.

The collective lane (`_maybe_run_collective_before_kernel_opt` →
`run_collective_handler`, integrated by `_integrate_collective`) gates on
`TP > 1`, an exposed-communication share at or above the phase floor, a
`last_trace_analyze` snapshot, and no already-settled campaign for the same
analysis key. `HYPERLOOM_SKIP_COLLECTIVE` disables it;
`HYPERLOOM_COLLECTIVE_ONLY` inverts the entry so the lane runs alone and the
phase then hints `skip_to_sweep`.

## Where the former Iron Rules are enforced

The seven rules from the retired `kernel_agent.md` live in executable Python:

| Former rule | Real enforcer |
|---|---|
| IR-1 submit all candidates in parallel | `_batch_kernel_candidates` + `_DEFAULT_KERNEL_BATCH_PARALLEL=8` in `request_handlers.py` |
| IR-2 never modify source before GEAK submission | `_is_runtime_generated_kernel` gate in `request_handlers.py` |
| IR-3 integration is mandatory after every KEEP | `phases/kernel_stack.py::KernelStackPhase._auto_enqueue_pending_integrations` (called by `intent_router.py`) |
| IR-4 kill stale servers before restart | `_multi_node_server_lifecycle.py::restart_server_for_round` |
| IR-5 safe process management | `orchestrator/actions/executors/_subprocess_kill.py` |
| IR-6 use apply_kernel_patch.py --target-file | `request_handlers.py::_maybe_apply_kernel_patch` → `agents/kernel/tools/apply_kernel_patch.py::apply_kernel_patch` |
| IR-7 never modify GEAK config | GEAK invocation wrappers in `request_handlers.py` / `geak_runner.py` |

## Backend selection

GEAK owns the KERNEL phase by default and decides kernel strategy internally.
The per-kernel Forge backend is an opt-in:

- **Default**: `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=geak` (every launcher exports this default).
- **Forge (per-kernel)**: set `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=forge` exactly. Any
  other value (including `--backends` CLI flags, payload `backends` hints, or
  `GEMM_TUNING_BACKEND`) does not enable Forge.

GEAK GEMM tuning uses `run_gemm_tuning_handler`, which also defaults to GEAK
unless `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=forge` is set.

FlyDSL kernels (`source_type=flydsl`) are handled by Forge when it is enabled.

### Two dispatch paths for kernels

Collective kernels do **not** ride the per-kernel backend. A trace row whose
`kernel_contract.kind == "collective"` is routed as follows:

- **Per-kernel path** (`run_optimization` → GEAK / Forge): the row is dropped up
  front by `_batch_kernel_candidates` via `is_collective_candidate`, and is also
  withheld from `reusable_native_kernel_ids` so orchestration is never offered
  an id whose dispatch would be an empty batch. The FlyDSL rewrite route refuses
  such candidates independently (`collective_unsupported`).
- **Collective lane** (`run_collective_handler`): the Coordinator selects the
  hottest source-resolved collective candidate itself at KERNEL entry. Vendor
  RCCL/NCCL symbols never qualify — they are opaque binaries with no rewritable
  source. The supported `collective_op` values are `all_reduce`,
  `reduce_scatter` and `all_gather` (`SUPPORTED_COLLECTIVE_OPS`); each needs its
  own `torch.distributed` reference in the generated driver, so widening the set
  means adding one there first.

The lane is reached on the native/Forge KERNEL entry path; when GEAK owns the
phase `_on_enter_kernel` returns before it. Under the default
`KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=geak` it therefore runs only via
`HYPERLOOM_COLLECTIVE_ONLY`, which turns the GEAK branch off. Its own gate keys
on `TP > 1` and exposed-communication share, not on the backend order value.

The lane writes three SharedState fields into `state.json`:

| Field | Contents |
|---|---|
| `last_collective` | The most recent campaign result: `status`, `decision`, `kernel_name`, `kernel_speedup`, `kept` and the integrate verdict. |
| `collective_attempts` | One row per logical campaign, deduplicated by `collective_attempt_id` so a resumed or salvaged run does not double-count. |
| `collective_only_mode` | Mirrors `HYPERLOOM_COLLECTIVE_ONLY`, so a reader can tell a collective-only session from one where the lane merely happened to run. |

## Toolkit installation

The kernel tool scripts live under
`src/hyperloom/agents/kernel/tools/` and are resolved at runtime via the
`HYPERLOOM_KERNEL_AGENT_ROOT` env var (set to `<repo>/src/hyperloom/agents/kernel`
by the CLI bootstrap). Install everything via:

```bash
export REPO_ROOT="$(pwd)"    # hyperloom repo root
bash "$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/agents/kernel/scripts/install.sh"
source "${USER_DATA_PATH:-/workspace/hyperloom}/runtime/kernel-agent.env.sh"
```

`install.sh` is idempotent. It sets up TraceLens, GEAK, Ray, and writes the
env file. Re-run it after a venv rebuild or before each session.

Required env vars:

| Variable | Set by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | operator | Anthropic-side key; GEAK and TraceLens both run Claude Code |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | operator | Anthropic-side endpoint (point it at your gateway) |
| `TRACELENS_ROOT` | `install.sh` (operator may override) | TraceLens checkout; installer clones to `.cache/TraceLens` by default |
| `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER` | launcher (default `geak`) | Set to `forge` to enable per-kernel Forge |

Optional:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TRACELENS_INTERNAL_ROOT` | TraceLens internal extension; unset = open-source-only |
| `KERNEL_OPT_MAX_PARALLEL` | Override the 8-concurrent-kernel default |
| `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_KERNEL_OPT_MAX_PARTIAL` | Override partial-attempt retry cap (default 2) |
| `KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_BUDGET_MIN` | Force the per-optimization wall-clock budget in minutes (default 60); wins over the LLM-authored payload value |

Collective lane:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HYPERLOOM_SKIP_COLLECTIVE` | Truthy disables the collective lane outright |
| `HYPERLOOM_COLLECTIVE_ONLY` | Truthy runs ONLY the collective lane at KERNEL entry (GEAK / fusion / per-kernel are skipped), then hints `skip_to_sweep` |
| `HYPERLOOM_COLLECTIVE_KEEP_PCT` | E2E KEEP threshold in percent for the collective integrate (default `1.0`); must be finite and non-negative |
| `FORGE_COLLECTIVE_TIMEOUT` | Wrapper timeout in seconds (default 14400 = 4h); a payload `timeout` wins over it |
| `FORGE_COLLECTIVE_AGENT_TIMEOUT` | Per-agent timeout in seconds handed to forge-collective as `--agent-timeout-sec` |

## Artifact layout

All kernel tool output lands under
`$USER_DATA_PATH/kernel-agent/runs/<session_id>/`:

```
runs/<session_id>/
  session_state.json
  kernel_candidates.json
  tracelens/
    analysis.md                 # TraceLens canonical report (not copied by Hyperloom)
    tracelens_report.json
    system_findings/
    category_findings/
  optimization_attempts.jsonl
  prompts/<attempt_id>.md
  optimized/<attempt_id>_stdout.log
  verification/<kernel_id>.json
  results/<kernel_id>.json
  logs/<tool>/<run_id>.log
  status/<tool>/<run_id>.json
```

Cross-task GEAK artifacts keyed by `kernel_id` live at
`$USER_DATA_PATH/kernel-agent-workspace/<kernel_id>/`.

### Per-attempt stdout file naming

`run_attempt` in `kernel_optimization.py` writes one file per attempt under
`runs/<session_id>/optimized/`:

| Mode | Filename | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Real backend run | `<attempt_id>_stdout.log` | Raw subprocess stdout (GEAK conversation log) |
| `--dry-run` | `<attempt_id>_optimized<source_suffix>` (e.g. `.cu`) | Synthetic placeholder for smoke tests |

**Backward compatibility**: prior to 2026-05 the real-backend file shared the
`<attempt_id>_optimized<suffix>` name and contained subprocess stdout. That caused
`_source_text_looks_complete` to false-positive match generic English in transcript
lines and promote the log to `artifact_source = source_file`. The breakdown
collector uses `glob("<attempt_id>*")` so it discovers both naming schemes
transparently.

## Multi-node mode

When `--nodes >= 2`, the optimization sandbox has no GPU. Handlers adapt:

- **Applying patches**: `apply_kernel_patch.py` detects multi-node and fans the
  patch to every pod via `python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.multi_node apply-patch`.
  Revert uses `manifest.multinode.host_backup_map` to hit the same pods.
- **Compiling/benchmarking**: Forge/GEAK backends use
  `python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.multi_node kernel-bench` instead of
  local `hipcc`.
- **Integration**: `integrate_handler` forces a full server restart after a
  successful apply so the re-baseline measures the patched modules.
- **RayJob recreate**: `_replay_kernel_patches_for_multi_node` replays all
  applied kernel patches when a new RayJob pod starts.
