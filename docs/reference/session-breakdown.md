# `session_breakdown.json` integration in Hyperloom

```{note}
This page is for **integrators and downstream consumers** — teams building
dashboards, reporting pipelines, or services
that read Hyperloom session output programmatically. If you just ran an
optimization and want to check your results, read the three headline fields
described in [Run a Hyperloom optimization](../how-to/optimize.md#output-and-artifacts)
first.
```

`session_breakdown.json` is the single external contract between
the `inference_optimizer` runtime (producer) and any downstream
consumer (results service, notebooks, custom
dashboards). One file per session, written to
`$SESSION_DIR/session_breakdown.json` at session end (and on
operator demand using [`dump_session_breakdown.py`](operator-scripts.md)).

The authoritative source of truth for the wire shape is
[`src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/breakdown/schema.py`](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom/blob/main/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/breakdown/schema.py).
This page describes the contract from a consumer's perspective.

---

## Versioning

The top-level `schema_version` field is a stable string. New exports use the
unified optimization wire shape:

```json
"schema_version": "hyperloom.session_breakdown.v5.0"
```

V5 is a breaking cutover for optimization results: consumers read only
`optimizations`; the old `optimization_stack`, attribution, GEAK invocation,
Forge invocation, and GEMM-tuning result projections are no longer emitted.
Archived V2/V3/V4 documents require a downstream migration before V5 readers
consume them.

Compatibility rules:

* **Parse the version, do not gate on string equality**. Read the
  `vN[.M]` prefix and compare the major component so a future minor
  revision of V5 is still accepted.
* **New optional fields** might appear at any time without bumping
  the major version. Consumers must tolerate unknown keys.
* **Renamed, removed, or semantically changed** fields require a major
  bump. Only one version is written per session; there is no parallel
  write of the previous version's file.
* **Missing data** is always represented as `null`, `[]`, or `{}` —
  never as a default / fabricated value. Consumers MUST treat
  missing data as "not available".
* All values are JSON-serializable (no dataclasses, enums, or
  Python-specific types in the wire shape).

The `exporter_version` field carries the exporter implementation version
(currently `"session-breakdown-1.0.0"`), independent of the Hyperloom package
version, for incident triage and per-version filtering.

---

## Top-level shape

The following JSON structure shows all top-level fields in `session_breakdown.json`.

```text

  "enablement":                  { /* enablement / targeted-build subsystem summary */ }
}
```

The `session` (SessionMeta) section also carries `user_data_path` and a
`recovery` sub-object in addition to the fields documented in §3.

All sections use the `total=False` TypedDict convention — every field
is optional. Consumers should expect partial documents when a session
ended early (`baseline_failed`, `time_exhausted` before kernel-opt
started, …).

---

## `optimizations` — canonical adopted optimizations

`optimizations` is the only section downstream dashboards need to read for
formally adopted optimization results. It normalizes Warm Replay, Explore,
Framework Agent, and Kernel Agent KEEPs without exposing internal action names
such as `integrate_patch`.

```

`source` is one of `warm_replay`, `explore`, `framework_agent`,
`kernel_agent`, or `unattributed`. Kernel entries additionally identify
`backend=geak|forge` and `execution_mode=whole_pipeline|per_kernel`.
Only validated entries contribute to `summary_by_source` and
`summary_by_kind`. The former answers which agent or phase produced the
gain; the latter groups the same entries by `optimization_kind`. These
summaries are alternate views of the same gains and must not be added
together.

A `kernel_agent` entry's `optimization_kind` records which lane produced it:
`gemm_tuning`, `kernel_fusion`, `kernel_collective`, or `kernel_patch` for a
generic source-level rewrite. A `kernel_collective` entry comes from the
Coordinator-owned collective lane, so it carries `action=collective` with
`variant_name=forge_collective` and `backend=forge`, and retains
`collective_op`, `world_size`, `collective_attempt_id`, and `integration_id` as
optional evidence joining the entry back to its campaign record. Collective
gain is bucketed into its own `collective` attribution family
(`collective_pct_of_total`) so multi-rank communication wins get a dedicated
row instead of falling through to `other`; its phase attribution still
resolves to `kernel_agent`.

`backend_attempts` retains adopted and non-adopted GEAK/Forge attempts,
including KEEP, PARTIAL, REVERT, and FAILED outcomes. `sequence` is ordered
within each kernel. Adopted kernel entries link back through
`adopted_attempt_id`. Missing producer attempt IDs receive a stable
session/kernel/backend/sequence ID. When multiple KEEP attempts match the
same entry and the producer did not identify the adopted one, the link stays
`null` and a warning is emitted rather than guessing.

GEAK's candidate-time `kernel_journey.e2e` values are provisional until the
orchestrator rebench completes. If the measured candidate does not beat
`current_best`, the journey row is rewritten with `validated=false`,
`decision=REVERT`, and `integrated=false`. The original claimed gain remains
available only as `self_reported_e2e_gain_pct`, alongside the measured and
comparison throughput used by the rejection.

`validation` carries the attribution lineage and reconciliation diagnostics
previously available only through the legacy attribution projection.
`validation.source_breakdown` retains non-entry gain categories such as
Sweep, params, and backend exploration without treating `sweep`,
`conc_sweep`, or `validate_stack` as adopted optimizations.
`gemm_tuning_runs` retains the complete tuning run records; the corresponding
adopted gain remains represented exactly once by a `gemm_tuning` entry.

`gain_method` is `ledger`, `legacy_ledger_derived`, `reconstructed`,
`throughput_derived`, or `missing`; `source_phase` and
`validated_at_stack_len` preserve the evidence needed to audit historical
source, validation, and gain inference. V4 conversion reconstructs backend
attempts and GEMM runs from canonical operation streams when that evidence is
present, and marks validation as synthesized from validated adoptions.

The historical `optimization_stack`, attribution, GEAK invocation, Forge
invocation, and GEMM-tuning result projections are not emitted in the new wire
shape. Their required downstream evidence is instead normalized into the
canonical fields above.

When Warm Replay uses a donor recipe, `kb_provenance.warm_replay` also
preserves the available `donor_canonical_id`, `donor_model`,
`donor_session_id`, `donor_family_tags`, `donor_gain_pct`, and
`donor_breakdown_link`. Fields absent from the source recipe remain absent
rather than being inferred.

## `session` — `SessionMeta`

The `session` section contains the following metadata fields.

| Field              | Type    | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session_id`       | string  | Hyperloom-internal session id (from `manifest.session_id`).                                  |
| `claw_session_id`  | string \| null | Hosted SaFE / Claw id; populated from env `CLAW_SESSION_ID`.                          |
| `sandbox_user_id`  | string \| null | Hosted SaFE user id; populated from env `SANDBOX_USER_ID`.                            |
| `created_at_utc`   | string  | ISO-8601 UTC.                                                                                |
| `ended_at_utc`     | string  | ISO-8601 UTC.                                                                                |
| `stop_reason`      | string  | One of `target_reached`, `time_exhausted`, `global_converged`, `max_ticks`, `baseline_failed`, ... |
| `max_minutes`      | int     | Configured time budget.                                                                       |
| `elapsed_minutes`  | float   | Actual wall-clock.                                                                            |
| `host`             | string  | Hostname of the Coordinator pod.                                                              |
| `code_revision`    | string  | Hyperloom git SHA.                                                                            |
| `pid`              | int     | Coordinator PID.                                                                              |
| `session_dir`      | string  | Concrete session directory, typically `$USER_DATA_PATH/<model_basename>/<timestamp>/`.       |
| `tick_count`       | int     | Number of Coordinator ticks.                                                                  |
| `image`            | string \| null | Container image fully-qualified, if configured.                                       |

---

## `workload` — `Workload`

The workload the session optimised: model, framework, GPU type, shape,
precision, and the optimization objective (gain %, target throughput,
baseline-relative, or time-only). See `schema.py::Workload` for the
full field list. Consumers should treat the `objective.kind` enum as
the canonical optimisation goal.

---

## `baseline` — `Baseline`

The starting point Hyperloom measured before any modifications.
Includes throughput, accuracy, optional time to first token (TTFT) and end-to-end latency (E2EL), the materialised
benchmark config path, attempt history (in case the baseline required
retries), and the `BenchmarkInvocation` record needed to **replay**
the exact baseline benchmark.

`baseline.invocation.framework_args_source` is one of:

* `log_non_default_args`: Most authoritative (parsed from the
  vllm/sglang server's own arg echo).
* `log_args_line`: `Args: Namespace(...)` header.
* `log_python_cmd`: Literal `python …` launch line scraped from logs.
* `yaml_cmd`: `cmd:` / `command:` / `launch:` field in the
  materialised config YAML.
* `yaml_benchmark`: Synthesised from Magpie's `benchmark.*` YAML
  fields.
* `unknown`: None of the above; a warning is appended to
  top-level `warnings`.

`extra_envs` is allowlist-filtered to keep secrets out of the
breakdown. Do not assume it contains every env var the session ran with.

---

## `final` — `Final` (SaFE contract core)

The end-state Hyperloom validated against the SaFE (Safe and Fast Execution) contract. The two most important fields for
downstream consumers:

| Field                              | Meaning                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `throughput_tok_s_per_gpu`         | Validated end-of-session throughput. The headline number.                                 |
| `cumulative_gain_pct_validated`    | Validated cumulative gain vs `baseline.throughput_tok_s_per_gpu`. The headline %.         |
| `action_path`                      | Ordered list of `action:variant` labels that made the final stack — the recipe.            |
| `extra_server_args`                | The exact extra args needed to reproduce the final config.                                 |
| `extra_envs`                       | The exact env overrides needed to reproduce the final config (allowlisted, no secrets).    |
| `invocation`                       | Same shape as `baseline.invocation`; lets a consumer replay the final benchmark.          |
| `closing_phase_entered`            | True iff Coordinator entered the closing phase cleanly (vs SIGTERM exit).                  |

> Consumer best practice: index on
> `(session.session_id, final.throughput_tok_s_per_gpu,
> final.cumulative_gain_pct_validated, workload.model_name,
> workload.gpu_type)`. Everything else is detail.

---

## `phase_timeline` — `PhaseEvent[]`

Chronologically ordered events, one per Coordinator action completion.
Each entry has `action`, `task_id`, `status`, `decision`,
`key_metric`, optional `kernel_id` (for kernel-owned actions),
optional `workspace`, and an `extras` dict for action-specific payload.

Useful for rendering session-progress timelines and "what changed at
T+90 min" charts.

---

## `capability_summary` — `CapabilitySummary`

One card per live capability (`geak`, `forge`, `explore`, `sweep`,
`specialist`) with: `status`, `attempts`, `keeps`, `tested`,
`best_gain_pct`, `reason`. Legacy `backends`, `params`, and
`validate_stack` rows can appear when archived sessions are rebuilt.
Drives the per-session UI cards in Primus-Claw.

---

## `kernel_lifecycle` — `KernelLifecycle`

The 4+1-stage kernel pipeline:

* `detected`: TraceLens-identified hot kernels.
* `recommended`: Critic-filtered candidates with backend
  recommendations.
* `optimized`: Kernels with at least one completed backend attempt
  and `best_micro_speedup`.
* `adopted`: Kernels promoted into the final stack (end-to-end validated).
* `rejected`: Kernels considered then dropped, with `reason`.

The same `kernel_id` appears in multiple lists as it progresses.

---

## `collective` — `Collective`

Multi-rank communication campaigns run at KERNEL entry, mirroring the
`collective_only_mode`, `collective_attempts` and `last_collective` SharedState
fields. Absent (`{}`) when the lane never ran.

* `only_mode`: mirrors `HYPERLOOM_COLLECTIVE_ONLY`, so a reader can tell a
  collective-only session from one where the lane merely happened to run.
* `attempts`: one `CollectiveAttempt` per logical campaign, deduplicated by
  `collective_attempt_id` so a resumed or salvaged run is not double-counted.
* `last`: the most recent campaign record, which additionally carries the
  measurement evidence the ledger rows omit — `bandwidth` (per case: `bytes`,
  `algbw_gbps`, `busbw_gbps`) and `artifact_files`.

This section is deliberately separate from `optimizations`. Adoption is decided
by `integration_decision` (the E2E gate), not by `decision` (the
microbenchmark), so a campaign that wins its micro run and then loses the gate
never reaches `optimizations` — and without this section would leave no trace
in the breakdown at all. Read `integration_gain_pct` against
`integration_base_tput` / `integration_new_tput` for the throughput delta that
actually decided the outcome; `kernel_speedup` is microbenchmark-only.

---

## `param_search`

The canonical field is `explore_search` (the native merged ledger), with
`ParamSearchEntry` records for every tested variant: `status` ∈ `accepted` /
`rejected` / `tested`, the `extra_server_args` / `extra_envs` it injected, the
`output_throughput` it measured, and the resulting `gain_pct`. The
`param_search` ledger is a v1-reader compatibility alias for the same data;
`params` and `backends` are older compatibility aliases emitted for archived
sessions and old readers. The section also includes
`synergy_attempted`, `discovered_flags`, and `backend_winners_history`.

---

## `sweep`

Final concurrency / input sequence length (ISL) / output sequence length (OSL) sweep. Always includes `all_variants`
(a `SweepPoint[]`) and `best_overall`. `best_for_each_conc` and
`pareto_front` are populated when the sweep grid is large enough.

---

## `critic_robustness`

Decision-review trail: every Critic iteration (verdict + paths to
request / judge_bundle / emit / review JSONs), plus every Robustness
signal (`crash` / `stall` / `disk_full` / `cluster_fault` / …).

---

## `telemetry`

Paths only (no copied content): `baseline_report_path`,
`profile_report_paths[]`, `torch_trace_paths[]`,
`system_profile_paths[]`, `server_log_paths[]`, and a
`gpu_monitor_aggregate` summary.

Paths are session-dir relative when the producer can express them
that way; absolute otherwise. Consumers that need to pull raw
artifacts (for example, for a replay) should resolve relative paths against
`session.session_dir`.

### `telemetry.orchestration_context`

Health of the orchestration conversation's compaction loop (`OrchestrationContext`).
All fields are `total=False`; sessions predating this field report zeroes.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `seed_prompts` | int | Full-state SEED pushes to the orchestration backend |
| `delta_prompts` | int | Thin DELTA pushes (verbose state omitted) |
| `compactions` | int | `orchestration_checkpoint` events recorded |
| `degenerate_compactions` | int | Compactions skipped on an unusable summary |
| `tick_count` | int | Ticks executed; denominator for the rates below |
| `compactions_per_tick` | float | `compactions / tick_count`; near 1.0 means every tick re-seeds the conversation |
| `delta_ratio` | float | `delta_prompts / (seed + delta)`; near 0 means the DELTA path is not being reached |
| `context_tokens_at_compaction` | dict[str, int] | `min` / `median` / `max` token water level at each compaction; a `min` above the soft budget means the token trigger cannot be un-tripped by compacting |

---

## `enablement` — admission, round lifecycle, builds & attempt runtimes

`EnablementBreakdown`. The enablement subsystem's observability section: which
lane was admitted, what each authoring round did, the patches and stack actions
it landed, the attempt runtimes it provisioned, and the targeted builds (AITER /
sgl-kernel / vLLM-source) it attempted.

Emitted when the lane did something, or when it was explicitly turned off — the
opt-out is what explains a run that failed to establish a baseline without
anything trying to repair it. Since `all` is the default, an armed lane that was
never needed stays hidden.

Admission and round lifecycle are reported independently of the artifacts: a
boot-origin round repaired by a plain source patch provisions no runtime and
builds nothing, and would otherwise leave no trace at all.

Admission and lifecycle (always present when the block is emitted):

| Field                       | Type   | Description                                                                              |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mode`                      | string | Admitted lane from `--enablement`: `off` / `launch` / `eval` / `all`.                        |
| `engaged`                   | bool   | A round was dispatched, attempted, or landed a patch. `false` with a non-`off` mode means the lane was armed but never needed. |
| `origin`                    | string | Trigger origin: `boot` (cannot launch) or `eval` (accuracy).                                 |
| `attempts`                  | int    | Authoring rounds dispatched this session.                                                    |
| `dispatched`                | bool   | An authoring round is in flight.                                                             |

| `gpu_arch`           | string             | Explicit target arch (`gfx942` / `gfx950` / …).                                |
| `max_jobs`           | int                | Parallelism cap passed to the compile.                                         |

| `failure_class`      | string             | One of the `FAILURE_CLASSES` values, or `"ok"`.                                |
| `failure_summary`    | string             | Human-readable reason (agent decision input).                                  |

`installed_versions` is a free-form string → string provenance map copied
verbatim from the build manifest. Keys include torch and commit-SHA stamps,
`arch`, and the component ref keys `aiter_ref` / `vllm_ref` / `sgl_kernel_ref`
(the first present ref is also surfaced as the top-level `ref` field). When a
discovered PR ref drove the build, it additionally carries a `source_pr_url`
key pointing at the source PR. Because the map is free-form, `source_pr_url`
is not a declared TypedDict key — consumers should read it opportunistically.

---

## `source_files` — `SourceFiles`

Pointers to the raw artifacts the breakdown was built from
(manifest, state, baseline_report, profile_reports[], …). Use this
when you need to drop into the raw session artifacts for deeper
investigation than the breakdown summarises.

## Producing the file

* **Live, in-session**: The Coordinator emits the `session_breakdown`
  action and the `cli.py` finally-block as a safety net.
* **Offline and historical**: See
  [Hyperloom operator scripts](operator-scripts.md):
  ```bash
  python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
      --session-dir /path/to/session \
      [--output /tmp/breakdown.json]
  ```

All three paths share the same builder
(`hyperloom.inference_optimizer.breakdown.build`), so the output is identical
regardless of producer.

---

## Stability guarantee

The Hyperloom team commits to the following compatibility guarantees.

1. Never removing or renaming a documented field within a
   major `schema_version`. Such changes require a major bump, as the
   `v5.0` optimization cutover did.
2. Never fabricating values for fields the runtime did not
   actually measure. Missing → null / `[]` / `{}`.
3. Adding new optional fields freely. Consumers must tolerate
   unknown keys.

Consumers can rely on these guarantees for production indexing and
alerting.
